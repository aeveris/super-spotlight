# super-spotlight

## Description

This is an extremely simple search game, where your objective is to find objects using your mouse and clicking on them to increase your score.
There are (as of now) three types of objects:
* objects with a dashed outline: click on these to gain points
* objects with a dotted outline: avoid clicking on these objects as each of them will cost you a life
* objects with a solid outline: you must click on these before they vanish - not only to gain a lot of points, but also to avoid losing a life
All of these objects will appear at random, and only have a limited lifespan - so be quick!

The game ends if the number of remaining lifes reaches 0.
